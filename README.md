Problem Statement
AtliQ is a fast-growing hardware company that sells various products to customers in many countries through various channels, including retail, direct sales, and distributor networks, both online and in brick-and-mortar stores. To support its growth and make data-driven decisions, AtliQ needs a data analytics team.

Created 2 reports for the sales team which will help them to evaluate customer performance and understand their market performance with respect to their target

In this project, I created a sales report using excel pivot tables which will enable businesses to determine effective customer discounts, facilitate negotiations with consumers, and identify potential business expansion opportunities in promising countries. The reports generated will provide actionable insights and recommendations for businesses to optimize their sales strategies, enhance customer satisfaction, and maximize revenue generation.

I have learned the following:
